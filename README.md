# Advanced Weaponiser 2 to Custom Weapons 2 Porting Project

Using [Custom Weapons 2](https://github.com/404UserNotFound/CustomWeapons2) we plan to remake all of Advanced Weaponiser 2 in one big aw2 Sub Plugin.

Includes weapon configs, updated to be as exact to the latest versions from AW2 as possible.

Rebalancing ideas of our own will not be included - modify these configs on your own.

All weapon config's descriptions will be credited, with Self-Made support for the creators.
Configs will be set up for the original models they used, if available, and if we agree that the model isn't too "screwy".
